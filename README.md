## What is S t r e t c h e d?
S t r e t c h e d is a puzzle game built around an environment-stretching mechanic. One player is inside a level trying to reach a goal. A second player uses a mobile device to stretch the world around the first player to help them reach a goal.

## How we built it
1. node.js - JavaScript networking library
2. socket.io - JavaScript event-driven, real-time networking library
3. three.js - In-browser graphics rendering library
4. Blender - 3D modeling/level design
